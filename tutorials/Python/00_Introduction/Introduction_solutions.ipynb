    "## Course overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to teach the basics of python programming with a focus on its application in computational biochemistry. Assuming no previous knowledge of python, we start by explaining the basic building blocks (e.g. variables, conditionals, and lists) and build upon these to show examples of how python can be used to solve problems related to computational biochemistry (e.g. analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial does not aim to completely cover every aspect of python programming, this unfortunately would not be feasible in a half day session. Instead we encourage attendees to use this as a jumping point into learning more about python and its many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend the following useful resources for python:\n",
    "- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/) (tutorials, library reference, ...)\n",
    "- [CodeAcademy Python tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is thought across a series of jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Introduction\n",
    "1. Basic Types\n",
    "2. Variables\n",
    "3. Conditionals\n",
    "4. Loops\n",
    "5. Lists\n",

    "These notebooks are contained within their own labelled/named directories. Within these directories you will also sometimes find `datafiles` sub-directories that contain all the relevant data to run the notebook, in addition to copies of the notebooks with the exercise solutions (whose name ends in `_solutions.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that each section be followed in order, however those with prior experience with python may wish to jump to the later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launching the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the `setup.md` \"Starting the tutorial\" instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, using a terminal (Anaconda prompt in Windows) do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will first need to activate the conda environment: `conda activate OxPython`\n",
    "2. Then you will need to start the jupyter notebook server: `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "3. From there navigate to the desired directory and click on the `.ipynb` notebook you wish to open.\n",
    "4. Solutions for some of the notebooks are provided under `<notebook_name>_solutions.ipynb`, we recommend you only open these once you have finished going through a notebook.\n",
    "5. To close the notebooks, click on \"File\" -> \"Close and Halt\".\n",
    "6. You may then also want to quit the jupyter notebook server altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a useful way to demonstrate python code in a clear and organised manner. Each notebook is composed of a series of `cells` which can either contain text (such as this one) or code (which will usually have the words `In []:` next to them). You can type in code `cells` by clicking on them and typing whatever changes you want to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells can be used to run any valid python code. To do this, simply click on the cell and press the `Run` button in the toolbar above, or type `Shift+Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** All code executed is retained in the `memory` of the notebook. That means that if you `import` a module or declare a variable, these will be seen and can interact with code executed in `cells` further down the notebook. There are many places in this tutorial where modules are imported early on in the notebook and used in subsequent code `cells`. We therefore recommend that tutorial users do not jump to later parts of the notebook without doing the earlier ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks can be cleared to their original state by navigating to `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`. A further prompt will ask you if you wish to clear all the outputs, pressing on this will return the notebook to a state where no code `cells` have been run.\n"

    "The `print` function takes an input value (some text, in quotation marks) and prints the text as output (without the quotation marks). One should note that Python is case-sensitive - ie. we can't use `Print` or `PRINT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst `print` is a very simple function, it is one of the most useful. It allows us to write out any information relevant to our python code. This can be anything from usage instruction to the output of some calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As of python 3, the inputs to the 'print' function must be placed within parantheses. If you use code developed for python 2.7 or lower, you may notice that this requirement is not followed and therefore will cause issues if run using python 3+. There are other key differences between python 3 and previous versions, some of which will be covered in this tutorial. For a more detailed look into them, the following resource may be of use: [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/pyporting.html). As python 2.7 will reach end of life as of January 2020, we strongly recommend that no new code be written in python 2.7."

Any text that comes after this is considered to be a comment and is ignored by the python interpreter. It is considered good practice to comment your code in order to make it more readable for yourself and future users. Other means of commenting python code, such as docstrings, also exist and will be briefly covered in section 8 of this tutorial."

    "Whilst jupyter notebooks can be useful for demonstrating python code and prototyping new ideas, the main way in which to run python code is to execute a script. To do this, you need to write the python instructions within a file and execute it via the python interpretor.\n",

    "```\n",

However, Python is extremely flexible, can be made reasonably fast under the hood, and it is relatively easy to run on different operating systems. This is the reason why it popularity exploded in recent years, especially in computational and data sciences: its clean syntax allows to write clear and concise programs, while sacrificing speed to a minimum."

Matlab's interpreter is not free and open source, so you won't be able to run your code unless you keep paying for a licence. R is a fantastic language for statistical computing, but it is very domain-specific. Python, in contrast, is free, open source and has a wide domain of applicability and it is therefore a very powerful language to know, for beginners and experts alike."
