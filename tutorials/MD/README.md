# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Molecular Dynamics Tutorial

## Content

Contained here is a tutorial to get your started with the basics of Molecular Dynamics simulations.

This tutorial demonstrates the use of [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) to run a short simulation of a HIV-1 protease.
The simulation is then analyzed using [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), [NGLView](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview), and [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/).


## Getting started

If you are doing the Oxford Computational Biochemistry course, please see the [setup instructions](setup.md).

Note that you will need to have already completed the setup instructions for the [python tutorial](../Python/setup.md).
