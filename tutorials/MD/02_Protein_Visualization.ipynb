    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the HIV-1 protease structure (PDB ID: 1HSG). It is a homodimer with two chains of 99 residues each. Before starting to perform any simulations and data analysis, we need to observe and familiarize with the protein of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various software packages for visualizing molecular systems, but here we will guide you through using two of those; NGLView and VMD:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NGLView](http://nglviewer.org/#nglview): An IPython/Jupyter widget to interactively view molecular structures and trajectories.\n",
    "* [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/): VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could either take your time to familiarize with both, or select which one you prefer to delve into.\n",
    "NGLView is great for looking at things directly within a jupyter notebook, but VMD can be a more powerful tool for visualizing, generating high quality images and videos, but also analysing simulation trajectories. \n"
